    "The Taylor Swift dataset on Hugging Face is a collection of lyrics from Taylor Swift's songs, which have been curated and tokenized for use with Hugging Face's natural language processing tools. The dataset includes lyrics from all of Taylor Swift's albums, including deluxe editions and bonus tracks. The dataset is provided in JSON format and includes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a song and includes the album, song name, lyrics, and the year of release. Additionally, each song's lyrics have been tokenized into individual words or subwords, which makes it easy to use with Hugging Face's transformers, a popular framework for training and deploying state-of-the-art language models\n",
